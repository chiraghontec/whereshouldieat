## 📈 **4. VALUE THEORY APPROACH**

### **4.1 Problem Value Quantification**

#### **Research Prompts for Problem Value:**
```
Problem Economics:
🔍 "cost of bad restaurant experience consumer behavior"
🔍 "time spent researching restaurants before dining out"
🔍 "restaurant discovery decision making time studies"
🔍 "economic impact restaurant recommendations word of mouth"

### **4.2 Value Creation Calculation**

```
Value Theory Framework:
├── Time Saved: Hours × Hourly Value Rate
├── Bad Experience Avoided: Frequency × Average Loss
├── Discovery Value: New Experiences × Experience Value
├── Social Value: Sharing/Recommendations × Network Effect
└── Restaurant Value: Customer Acquisition × LTV Improvement
```

#### **Example Value Calculation:**
```
Consumer Value Per Year:
├── Time saved researching: 20 hours × $25/hour = $500
├── Bad experiences avoided: 5 × $50 = $250
├── Discovery of hidden gems: 12 × $20 value = $240
├── Social sharing value: $50
└── Total Annual Value = $1,040

Willingness to Pay = 5-10% of value = $50-100/year
```
